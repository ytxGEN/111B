/* Starter project for Assignment 13 File I/O for Grade Average
   CS 111B, Craig Persiko's class.  
   
   Your job is to write a program to read the grades.txt file
   in this project, to produce output like shown here.

   "grades.txt" is the file your program should read.Â  "badformat.txt" is an example of a file that your program can't read, so a clear error message should be generated, as shown in the sample output.
